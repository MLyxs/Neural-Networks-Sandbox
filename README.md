# Neural-Networks-Sandbox
A Javascript implementation of a neural net for handwritten digit recognition.
The network was trained on the MNIST dataset in PYTHON 3.5.2 using KERAS library

<b><i>Neural Net for Handwritten Digit Recognition in JavaScript.html</i></b> - An html file that allows to draw a digit and then recognize it
<b><i>Python Code/create_mnist_model.py</i></b> - Python script that creates .h5 file with trained model
<b><i>neuronet_for_jscript_load_and_show.py</i></b> - Python script that forms a Javascript code for this model
